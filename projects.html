          <h3>Personalized News Feed API – Personal Project / CS50 Final Project (Ongoing)</h3>
          <p>This is a project I’m currently working on using Django REST Framework. Right now, I’m building out the serializers to control how the data is structured and returned from the API. The idea is to pull in real-time news from NewsAPI.org, let users filter content based on their interests, and secure everything with JWT authentication. I also plan to add background task handling with Celery and Redis, and eventually integrate Elasticsearch for better search and Kafka for real-time updates.</p>

          <h3>PARKWISE: Smart Parking Management System (September 2023)</h3>
          <p>I took charge of writing the research paper for this project, which looked at how smarter parking management could help ease traffic jams. While I handled the docs, the rest of the team worked on building an app that uses object detection to keep track of cars coming and going. We also added a simple way for people to reserve parking spots ahead of time, hoping to make parking less stressful and traffic flow smoother.</p>
