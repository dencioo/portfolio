          <h3>Movy API - Backend Project</h3>
          <p>Movy API is the backend I built during my Uplift Code Bootcamp to support my personal movie app, Movy Browser. Currently, it can create and manage watchlists entirely on the backend, while my frontend fetches movie data directly from TMDB API. I built it with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, so in the future, my frontend apps can use it for real-time movie data and user feature</p>

          <h3>Movy Browser - ReactJS</h3>
          <p>I built Movy Browser to explore how React can be used to create dynamic, interactive web apps. It lets users browse movies, view details, and search across categories—all powered by a TMDB API. Through this project, I got hands-on experience with React Hooks, React Router, and API integration while learning how to organize components and make the UI feel clean and responsive</p>

          <h3>Spinomo Wheel - Vanilla JS App</h3>
          <p>Spinomo Wheel is a fun little web app I built using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It lets users spin a colorful wheel to get random results, complete with smooth animations and satisfying effects. I made this project to practice DOM manipulation and event handling, and it ended up being one of my favorite ways to learn while creating something playful and interactive.</p>

          <h3>Personalized News Feed API / CS50 Final Project (Ongoing)</h3>
          <p>This is a project I’m currently working on using Django REST Framework. Right now, I’m building out the serializers to control how the data is structured and returned from the API. The idea is to pull in real-time news from NewsAPI.org, let users filter content based on their interests, and secure everything with JWT authentication. I also plan to add background task handling with Celery and Redis, and eventually integrate Elasticsearch for better search and Kafka for real-time updates.</p>

          <h3>PARKWISE: Smart Parking Management System (September 2023)</h3>
          <p>I took charge of writing the research paper for this project, which looked at how smarter parking management could help ease traffic jams. While I handled the docs, the rest of the team worked on building an app that uses object detection to keep track of cars coming and going. We also added a simple way for people to reserve parking spots ahead of time, hoping to make parking less stressful and traffic flow smoother.</p>
